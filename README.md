# Squardle

Squardle is a word puzzle game inspired by Wordle with a twist. Instead of guessing a single word, you have to guess five hidden words arranged in a grid. You have 15 attempts to find all the hidden words and can play as much as you'd like by refreshing the page! 

## Features
- Extracted exact Wordle word-list via Python script
- Visual feedback with colors: green for correct letters, yellow for letters in the wrong position, and gray for incorrect letters. Handles all edge cases
- Supports both physical and on-screen keyboard
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Play
1. Enter a 5-letter word guess using the on-screen keyboard or your physical keyboard.
2. Press "Enter" to submit your guess.
3. Letters will change colors to give you hints:
   - **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position.
   - **Yellow**: Correct letter but in the wrong position.
   - **Gray**: Incorrect letter.
4. You have 15 attempts to guess all five hidden words.
5. If you guess all the words correctly, you win!
